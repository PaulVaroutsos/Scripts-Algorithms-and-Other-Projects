This package contains various classes used to convert the rectangle free grid
coloring problem to an instance of SAT.

To map a problem to SAT:
1.  Set the NUM_COLORS, ROW_SIZE, and COLUMN_SIZE variables in ConstantHolder.java
2.  Run Mapper.java
The output file can be used in any SAT-solver such as walksat or minisat.

To unmap a solution from a SAT solver output
1.  Set the INPUT_FILE variable of UnMapper.java
2.  Run UnMapper.java
The validation result will be output into src/gridcoloringtosat/solution_squares
(The file to be unmapped should be formatted with one line saying "Instance Satisfiable"
followed by all of the variables on one line)
