To run this from NetBeans:
1. Set the project's "working directory" to this directory.
2. Set the projects main class to ec.Evolve
3. Set the projects arguments to "-file grid.params.greedy" or any parameter 
file of your choice.
(Or compile and run from the command line)

Package ec.* contains the source code for the ECJ. 
All source code for grid coloring is found in ec.app.Grid.  Source code for 
other apps have been removed.  To see more ECJ examples, download the complete 
source code from ECJ's website at http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/ecj/

Grid.java is the source code for solving rectangle free grid coloring.

ECJ's main class is ec.Evolve and it takes in a parameter file that may be given
as a command line parameter or indicated from inside NetBean's properties menu
as a run argument.  Two example files are included, grid.params.greedy and
grid.params.tournament.  They inherit the properties from their parent parameter
files greedy.params and tournament.params.  Keep in mind the genome size must be
consistent with the size of the grid.  For example for a 17x17 grid, a genome
size of 289 is needed.
