This project contains three main packages:
1.Evolutionary Computation
package ec

This package (ec.*) contains all of the source code for building evolutionary computation programs.

ECJ's main class is ec.Evolve and it takes in a parameter file that may be given as a command line parameter or indicated 
from inside the NetBean's project properties menu as a run argument.

package ec.app.grid
This package contains Grid.java, which is a subclass of ECJ's Problem class, that defines the evaluation function for 
solving grid coloring.  This is the only class of interest.  This class is given to ECJ in a parameter file (included) 
and utilized by ec.Evolve.
Source code for other apps have been removed.  To see more ECJ examples, download the complete source code from ECJ's 
website at http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/ecj/

Example parameter files are included in this directory.

2. Grid Coloring to SAT
This package contains files for converting the rectangle free grid coloring problem to SAT and unmapping a SAT solvers
output into a colored grid.

3. Mutation SAT 
This package contains a class that was used to try to combine both SAT and evolutionary computation to solve rectangle
free grid coloring problems.
