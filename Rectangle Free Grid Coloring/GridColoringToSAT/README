This project contains three main packages:
1.Evolutionary Computation
package ec

This package (ec.*) contains all of the source code for building evolutionary computation programs.

ECJ's main class is ec.Evolve and it takes in a parameter file that may be given as a command line parameter or indicated from inside the NetBean's project properties menu as a run argument.

package ec.app.grid
This package contains Grid.java, which is a subclass of ECJ's Problem class, that defines the evaluation function for solving grid coloring.  This is the only class of interest.  This class is given to ECJ in a parameter file (included) and utilized by ec.Evolve.
Source code for other apps have been removed.  To see more ECJ examples, download the complete source code from ECJ's website at http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/ecj/

Example parameter files are included in this directory.
