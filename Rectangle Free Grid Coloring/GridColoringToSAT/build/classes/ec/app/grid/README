To run this from NetBeans:
1. Set the project's "working directory" to this directory.
2. Set the projects main class to ec.Evolve
3. Set the projects arguments to "-file grid.params.greedy" or any parameter file of your choice.

Package ec.* is the source code for the ECJ evolutionary computation package.  All source code for grid coloring is found in ec.app.Grid.  Source code for other apps have been removed.  To see more ECJ examples, download the complete source code from ECJ's website at http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/ecj/
Package ecj.app.Grid is the source code for solving rectangle free grid coloring.

ECJ's main class is ec.Evolve and it takes in a parameter file that may be given as a command line parameter or indicated from inside NetBean's properties menu as a run argument.  Two example files are included, grid.params.greedy and grid.params.tournament.  They inherit the properties from their parent parameter files greedy.params and tournament.params.
